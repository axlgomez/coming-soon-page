# Base Apparel coming soon page

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

In this project I have built this **coming soon page**

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
